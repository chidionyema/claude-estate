"""pi-bridge — dispatch implementation work to MiniMax via a headless `pi` process.

Claude Code stays the interface and stays on the subscription; this server hands an
already-written, file-level plan to a cheap executor and hands back a SUMMARY.

Transport decision (measured 2026-08-06, receipts in the session that built this):
  - pi-agents RPC is NOT usable from here. `pi-agents/README.md`: the event bus is
    "process-local" and "A `start` request made outside an active session returns an
    error." An external MCP server can never emit into it.
  - `pi -p` (non-interactive) is the entry point that works.
  - `-ne` (no extensions) is REQUIRED. Without it the run completes the edit and then
    never exits — pi-crew holds the event loop open and only stops on SIGTERM
    (observed: 300s timeout, work done, process alive). With `-ne`: exit 0 in 7s.
  - TEXT mode, never `--mode json`. Same task: text = 174 bytes, json = 101_318 bytes.
    MCP tool results are resident in Claude's context and re-billed every later turn,
    so the stream is a cost bug. We return the final report + a diffstat, never a diff.

The gate is deliberately separate from the executor (`pi_gate`): a deterministic
typecheck/lint/test run costs nothing and must be spent before any LLM verification.

# --- Founder fence -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Money rail / identity / contract / migrations never leave Claude. architect-planner.md
# states this in prose to the planner; prose is not enforcement, so it is also a hard
# check here.
#
# The fence used to ban the literal prefix `store_platform/`. That is a directory, not a
# risk: 414 source files live under it and roughly 40 are money surface, so it refused
# the storefront UI, the design system and a read-only screenshot harness in order to
# protect StripeProvider.cs. A fence that blocks work it was never meant to block gets
# routed around by hand, which is how it stops being a fence.
#
# Two changes, and the second is what makes the first safe:
#   1. The patterns name the money surface itself, not its parent directory.
#   2. The fence now runs a SECOND time, after the executor, against the paths git says
#      it actually wrote. The pre-check only ever read a prose plan and could be walked
#      past without lying: "update the payment provider adapter" contains no fenced
#      token, so it passed, and the executor was free to write
#      store_platform/src/Store.Api/Payments/StripeProvider.cs unchecked. git cannot be
#      talked around.
#   3. Two tiers, because one list was doing two jobs at one strictness. `\bcheckout`
#      is a DOMAIN WORD, not a money surface: it appears in every plan that so much as
#      refuses a purchase, so it refused the commerce-mode work (a config switch and two
#      HTTP refusal codes) which mints nothing and charges nobody. Measured 2026-08-15:
#      the P1 plan of docs/SUBSCRIPTION_PROGRAM.md §17 came back
#      `REFUSED ... ['Checkout', 'checkout']`. Every genuinely dangerous checkout
#      operation is already named by another token — `\bstripe`, `/Payments/`,
#      `\bwebhook` — so HARD loses nothing by dropping it.
#
# HARD    = never dispatched, and a breach if the executor writes it anyway.
# REVIEW  = dispatched freely, but the run report cannot be read without seeing it.
# The point of the split is that "the executor does everything and Claude reviews" needs
# a tier that means REVIEW. Before this, the only way to say "read this carefully" was
# to say "never", and never is what gets routed around by hand at full price.
