"""Regression guard for the pi-bridge founder fence.

The fence protects money-rail / identity / contract / migration surface from the
non-interactive executor. It was widened wrong once (a bare `store_platform/` prefix
that refused 414 files to protect ~40) and narrowed wrong once (`\\bcheckout\\b`, whose
trailing word boundary cannot match `CheckoutEndpoints.cs`). Both directions are bugs,
so both directions are pinned here.

Run: python3 ~/.claude/mcp/test_pi_bridge_fence.py     (or: pytest that path)
